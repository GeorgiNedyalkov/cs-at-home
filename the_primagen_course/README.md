# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Complexity and Big O notation

1. What is Big O?

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input.

Big O describes the upper bound of the algorithm.

Example:

O of n - mean the algo grows linearly based on intput?

2. Why do we use it?

It helps make decisions on which data structures and algorithms to use.

3. Important concepts

- Growth is with respect to the input

Simple tricks is to look for loops.

Always drop constants.

## Sorting Algorithms

## Map

Consistent Hash. K(o) always returns K(o).

K => V
