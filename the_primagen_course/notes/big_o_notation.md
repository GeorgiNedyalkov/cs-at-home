# Complexity (Big O Notation)

Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It expresses how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.

In simpler terms, it's a way of expressing the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time complexity. Big O notation is represented by the letter "O" followed by a mathematical expression, which denotes the upper bound of the algorithm's runtime.

For example, suppose you have an algorithm that performs a linear search through an array. In the worst-case scenario, where the item is not found, the algorithm will have to search through every element of the array. In this case, the runtime of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the array. This can be expressed as O(n), where n is the size of the array.

Another example is an algorithm that sorts an array using bubble sort. The worst-case scenario for bubble sort is when the array is sorted in reverse order. In this case, the algorithm has to swap elements repeatedly until the array is sorted. The runtime of the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the array. This can be expressed as O(n^2), where n is the size of the array.

In general, a lower Big O notation indicates a better algorithm performance, as the growth rate is slower than the higher ones.

Size complexity and time complexity are both measures of the performance of an algorithm, but they measure different aspects of performance.

Size complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to perform a certain operation. It is usually expressed in terms of the amount of space required to store the data being processed. Size complexity is important in cases where memory is a limited resource or when dealing with very large datasets. It can be measured in terms of the number of variables, data structures, or bits required to store the data.

On the other hand, time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to perform a certain operation. It is usually expressed in terms of the number of operations the algorithm performs as a function of the size of the input. Time complexity is important in cases where the speed of the algorithm is crucial, especially when dealing with large datasets. It can be measured in terms of the number of basic operations, such as arithmetic, comparison, or assignment operations, required to perform the task.

For example, consider the problem of sorting an array of n integers. The size complexity of an algorithm to sort this array is simply the amount of memory required to store the array and any additional data structures used by the algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm to sort this array, on the other hand, is determined by the number of operations required to perform the sorting, such as comparisons and swaps, as a function of the size of the array.

In general, algorithms with lower time and size complexity are more efficient and desirable, as they require less time and memory to perform their tasks, respectively.
