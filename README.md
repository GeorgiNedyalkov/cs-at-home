## Binary Search

### What is Binary Search?

Binary Search Aloright is a "_Divide & Conquer_" algorithmic paradigm.

### Recursive implementation

_Problem_: Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order,
and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwize, return -1.

Spec: You must write an algorithm in `0(log n)` runtime complexity.

_Example 1:_

```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

### Selection Sort
