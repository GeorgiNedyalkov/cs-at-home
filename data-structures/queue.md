# Queue

A queue is a first-in-first-out data structure where items are added to the end of the queue(tail)
and items are removed from the front of the queue(head). It is an anology of the queue people form when
waiting for goods and services.

It is a linear data structure or a sequencial data structure.

Another use of the implementation of a queue is a _breath-first-search_

## Performance

- Adding to a queue: two constant time operations 2 O(i).
- Removing an element from a queue: is the same but reverse 2 O(i)

### Methods:

- enqueue: adding an element to the back of the queue.
- dequeue: removing an element from the front of the queue.
- peek: returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without removing it.
