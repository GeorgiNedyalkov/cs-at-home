# Trees

Trees are datastructures comprised of a root node and children nodes, which themselves have children
up until there is end node which has no children, referred to as a leaf.

DOM tree is a good example. File system is another.

### Temrinology

Root - The most parent node.
Height - The longest path from the root to the most child node.
Binary tree - a tree in which has at most 2 children, at least 0 children.
General tree - a tree with 0 or more children
Binary Search Tree - a tree which has a specific ordering to the nodes and at most 2 children
Leaves - a node withouth children.
Balanced - a tree is perfectly balanced when any node's left and right children have the same height.
Branching factor - the amount of children a tree has.

## Traversal of a tree

Attempting to traverse every single node.
