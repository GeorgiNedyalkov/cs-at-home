# Recursion

What is a recursion?

A function that calls itself until the problem is solved. This involves a "base case".
The base case is the point that the problem is solved at.

For every function there are three things:

1. Return Address:

Each function remembers where it was called because after it is done executing it should return to
the same return address and continue executing the code.

2. Return Value:

Each funciton has a return value or it can return undefined.

3. Arguments

For recursion we have three steps:

1. Doing something before recursion
2. Doing the recursion
3. Doing something after the recursion.
